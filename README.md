A Java library, used in a couple of my other projects, mostly doing 2D geometry things.
I might get round to documenting / extending / writing unit tests eventually.

Update (almost a decade since I wrote this) - I thought it would be amusing to convert it to Scala, so I did - see
[ScalaMathLib](https://github.com/danielrendall/ScalaMathLib). Neither of these projects is to be taken seriously; use
a proper maths library if you need one.
